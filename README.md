# img_info_entropy

Codes for image information theory, excluding basic VS environment but including necessary third-party environment which developers usually do not want to include but cost downloaders plenty of time to configure the environment. 

These codes are written in my fifth term but I can't upload them into the repository via github webpage. Thus, a new repository is created. 

Please add opencv_world453.dll/opencv_world453d.dll to your environment or to the folder including your executable files when you run it in the real environment.
